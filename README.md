# Starling-Murmuration
This project models and simulates the fascinating phenomenon of Starling Murmuration.

Objective: To measure from a realistic simulation the average energy spend by each bird, the angular momentum and the force that each bird has to withstand in a typical flight ritual.

Work Done: Computationally simulated the phenomenon by modelling each bird as an independent agent communicating and cooperating with other neighbouring agents.
